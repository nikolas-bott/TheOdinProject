    <h4>Spätzle is a really famous German food, espacilly in the southern part - mostly in swabia where it also was inveted. <br> It also can be eaten with Cheese and then you could say it's kinda like
        Mac And Cheese but It's waaay <b>better</b>. <br> The big difference between Spätzle and noodles is that its made with eggs. <br>
        Spätzle is usually just a side dish to a good roast venison etc. But if you are lazy and are looking for something delicous you may just eat it with gravy sauce. YUMMY!
