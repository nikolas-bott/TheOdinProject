    <h5>Spätzle is a really famous German food, espacilly in the southern part - mostly in swabia where it also was inveted. <br> It also can be eaten with Cheese and then you could say it's kinda like
        Mac And Cheese but It's waaay <b>better</b>. <br> The big difference between Spätzle and noodles is that its made with eggs. <br>
        Spätzle is usually just a side dish to a good roast venison etc. But if you are lazy and are looking for something delicous you may just eat it with gravy sauce. YUMMY!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon creme fraiche, sour cream, or plain yogurt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 package of Gravy Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, egg, salt, cayenne, crème fraîche, and milk in a mixing bowl. Whisk together until batter drips slowly off the whisk.<br>
             If batter seems too thin, add a bit more flour; if too thick, add a bit more milk. You can test the thickness using the smooth side of a cheese grater with fairly large holes.<br>
              If a dollop of the batter does not drip through the grating holes, it's the right consistency.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a simmer over medium-high heat.<br>
             Use a spatula to push a spoonful of batter through the holes of the smooth side of the grater into the simmering water.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>When dumplings rise to the surface of the water, they are done.<br>
             This will take just a few minutes. Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon, and repeat in batches with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
